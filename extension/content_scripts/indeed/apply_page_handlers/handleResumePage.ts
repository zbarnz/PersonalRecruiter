  // Wait for user to manually select a file. This part cannot be automated in a content script.
  // Consider displaying a message or using a placeholder action here.

  // After file selection, you might need to trigger any subsequent UI actions that are required.
  // For example, if there's a "Save" button that needs to be clicked after file upload, you can do so here.
  // Note: This assumes the UI does not change immediately upon file selection, as we can't detect that in a script.
